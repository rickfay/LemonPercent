## About

Lemon% is a challenge mod for The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. Much like a randomizer, items and chest contents have been completely rearranged, but unlike a randomizer, the placements are deliberate and, well, planned.

The goal of this plando was to put the glitches first. Relying on the game's intended completion logic won't get you very far. Dungeons are missing keys. Critical items are placed behind locks that should normally require those very items. And the Bow of Light has found a suitably devious hiding place as well...

## Advice to the Player

- Save often. While some preliminary testing has been done to show that the game can be completed successfully without crashing, this is still a very new hack, and I strongly advise you take precautions to not lose progress.


- Check out the [ZeldaSpeedRuns ALBW wiki](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/albw/) page for help to perform specific glitches.


- Some Quality of Life items are available fairly early on. You can choose to pick these up or ignore them to tailor the difficulty as you like:


    - The Kakariko Well has both the Blue and Red Mail
    - The Fortune-Teller has the Pouch
    - Ravio's Shop has taken on a new business model...


- Boosting onto ledges with regular bombs is NOT required. You may find it can help you get one or two items slightly earlier than intended, but it won't yield a significant advantage.


- The ALBW Randomizer Community has put out several high-quality tracker programs out there, and you're free to use whichever you like. I would recommend the tracker I built, LemonKong's "ALBW Randomizer Tracker" pack for [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/), as I've personally made sure it's equipped to handle all the crazy glitches and tricks from this plando. 

    - Be sure to check out the "Modify Glitch Logic" settings in the Options menu. For spoiler reasons I won't say which ones to enable, but as you play through the plando it should become apparent which ones are needed. 


<h2 style="color:red;">SOFTLOCK WARNINGS</h2>

- The Maiamai are for upgrading Bombs to Nice Bombs ONLY. Do not upgrade any other items or you may find yourself unable to progress the game.


- Do NOT blow up the rock in Lorule Castle using the Big Bomb Flower. This rock is required to perform Trial's Skip, and if you blow it up you will be unable to complete the game. I strongly advise you save before entering Lorule Castle as a precautionary measure.

## Guide

- I will be including a spoiler-full guide here at a later date. For now, enjoy the challenge!

## Installation

- More detailed instructions to come, but for now just know that you install it the same way you install a patch for the base ALBW Randomizer.

    - For 3DS Consoles: Unzip the download and drop the ```00040000000EC300``` folder into ```luma/titles/```

    - For the Citra Emulator: Unzip the download and drop the ```00040000000EC300``` folder into ```Citra/load/mods```


- The game should start with Link waking up in his house and Ravio immediately giving him an item before turning control over to the player. If this does not happen, the mod did not install correctly.

## Source Code Release

- I will be making the source code that generated this Plando available at a later date, really after I've had a chance to make a more user-friendly interface.


- The intent is to enable anyone who wants to make their own Plando to be able to do so.
